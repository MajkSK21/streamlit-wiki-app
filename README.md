Welcome to the **Streamlit Wiki App**! This project serves as an end-to-end implementation of a Text to Math Problem Solver. Utilizing the powerful Google Gemma 2 language model via LangChain Groq, this app combines advanced natural language processing and reasoning capabilities to understand, solve, and explain mathematical problems in a clear, step-by-step manner. Additionally, the app integrates Wikipedia search functionality to enhance user experience and provide context to the problems being solved.
